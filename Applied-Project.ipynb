    "Calculus provides powerful tools for understanding the behaviour of functions, but in many practical applications, we only have access to a finite set of discrete data points. This presents a challenge for constructing continuous functions that accurately represent the underlying relationship between quantities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of constructing a continuous function that passes through a set of discrete data points is known as data fitting, and interpolation is a specific type of data fitting that seeks to find a function that passes through a set of data points exactly, rather than just approximately.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The study of interpolation techniques is fundamental in the field of numerical analysis because it provides a means to construct a continuous function that approximates a given set of discrete data points. In many practical applications, it is often necessary to estimate the value of a function at points where the function is not explicitly defined, based on a finite set of data points.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple fields where interpolation is widely applied such as medical imaging (interpolation can be used to estimate values of medical imaging data, such as MRI or CT scans, at locations between the measured data points which is useful for image registration and analysis), finance (pricing of derivatives), and machine learning (interpolation is useful to fill in missing data points in a dataset, which can be later implemented in machine learning tasks such as regression and classification). \n",
    " \n",
    "Interpolation is a common task, but it's important to proceed with caution to avoid unexpected results. Choosing a suitable interpolation method depends on the level of risk and whether the function exhibits smooth or abrupt behaviour or trends at the extremes of the interval of interpolation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lagrange polynomial interpolation and cubic splines are two common techniques for interpolating data and constructing continuous functions that pass through a set of discrete data points. By using these methods, we can approximate the underlying function and estimate values at intermediate points, even if the original data was obtained only from a finite set of measurements. "

    "We will be solving the problems given to us by creating a function that performs piecewise-polynomial interpolation, investigating its convergence and accuracy for various degrees of polynomial and then using it on data provided to us in the brief. \n",
    "\n",
    "Piecewise-polynomial interpolation is one of four methods of interpolation we have looked at in the course, and has various pros and cons to its use in comparison to these other methods. Our data in part 4 oscillates quite sharply and rapidly, so piecewise linear interpolation would most likely be a poor choice for this as it has trouble being accurate at ‘bends’ where the gradient sign changes, although it is quite cheap computationally. \n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison, piecewise polynomial interpolation can capture these bends by using polynomials with sharp bends themselves. If our interpolation was not piecewise, it would likely struggle a great deal with accuracy for this data, as to have sufficiently many ‘turning points’ in the function, the polynomial would need a very high degree. This would be quite computationally expensive and would also mean that if we wanted to perform accurate cubic interpolation, we would need quite well-behaved data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Spline interpolation is a kind of piecewise polynomial interpolation that places a restriction on the continuity of the derivatives, which ensures greater smoothness in the interpolation. In part 4 we compare our approach to that of cubic spline interpolation, but in general spline interpolation will be more accurate the smoother the ‘correct’ function for the data is, and less accurate for more jagged, less smooth data, due to this restriction.

We evaluated our function using a cubic degree polynomial since it overcomes Runge's phenomenon while maintaining a high level of accuracy.

This could cause some error to exist between our function and the exact function. \n",

    "For part 2 we created a plot by looping over increasing step number N, or equivalently decreasing step-sizes, ‘h’, for different degree polynomials, and then interpolating our original data for evenly-h-spaced points, noting for each step-size the maximum error occurring in the interpolation. \n",
    "\n",
    "We took care to use a numpy set-difference function to ensure that the original data x1 and our h-spaced evaluation points never coincided throughout, as instructed in the brief. Then we plotted the maximum errors with their corresponding h-values for each degree polynomial, and displayed these alongside a plot of those h-values raised to the degree of the polynomial interpolation performed plus one, to demonstrate the convergence. We used a logarithmic y-scale and found that these pairs of lines had the same gradient, only varying in height of the lines, showing that the convergence of the maximum errors was ~ $h^{n+1}$ where n is the degree of the polynomial interpolation performed. \n",
    "\n",
    "To further check this point we created a second subplot which divided these maximum errors by $h^{n+1}$ and found that these were approximately but not completely constant, which is as we were expecting to show the aforementioned convergence, as it shows that the maximum errors and h^{n+1} only vary by a constant factor, which is equivalent to saying that the maximum errors is of order $h^{n+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However there was some degree of variance, which could just be accounted for by the accuracy of the method, and thus that python was making floating point errors due to the tiny size of our maximum errors. This problem was actually worse for some other choices of evaluation points and ranges of N, so we had to tune these as instructed in the brief to find a more robust convergence. In particular, some larger ranges for N resulted in such small ‘h’s that there were worse floating point errors and so quite noisy data, and the same was true for higher degree polynomials, because the more precise our interpolation is, the more the max errors become increasingly tiny."
