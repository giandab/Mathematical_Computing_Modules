# Mathematical-Computing
Coding projects from one of my university modules, examining the influence of computational methods across pure, applied and statistical areas of Mathematics.

Major Projects include:

Applied team project. Completed in a team of 6, this project looks at the theme of data interpolation.
Pure team project, focusing on graph theory.
Statistics project, using a Monte Carlo bootstrap method.
