# Mathematical-Computing
Coding projects from some of my university modules, examining the influence of computational methods across pure, applied and statistical areas of Mathematics.

Projects from module Introduction to Mathematical Computing include:

Applied team project. Completed in a team of 6, this project looks at the theme of data interpolation.  
Pure team project, focusing on graph theory.  
Statistics project, using a Monte Carlo bootstrap method.  

Projects from Computational Numerical Analysis:

Spectral Differentiation: This included using methods such as finite difference, the Fourier spectral method , the Chebyshev differentiation matrix and the Chebushev series to numerically differentiate a function. This was followed by analysing the speed and accuracy of each method under different conditions.  
Boundary Value: This project found numerical solutions to a boundary value problem using the Gauss-Seidel and Conjugate Gradient methods.
